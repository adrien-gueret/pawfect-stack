You are a witch. Not the greatest one of all, far from it! You're just an apprentice — everyone has to start somewhere. Your master has asked you to tidy up his cellar in order to channel all the magic as efficiently as possible. Sounds easy enough, right? But that's without taking into account your master's pet cat, who has plenty to say about it… and seems quite determined to get in your way.

## Oracle of Chaos

You are a cat. Probably the most beautiful one of all, let's be honest. But today, you're worried. Your human has taken on a young witch to tidy up his cellar. And you don't like that one bit! As a proper cat, you'll do everything in your power to make her life difficult. Sounds easy enough, right? But that's without taking into account the little witch, who won't let herself be pushed around — and she's got more than a few magic tricks up her sleeve…

## About items...

In both games, you'll have to handle some magical items. Some of them have some specificites:

- Potion: Very fragile. If another item falls on it, or if it falls by itself, it will break.
- Grimoires: The more grimoires are placed next to each other, the higher their magic score will be.
- Dried plant: Needs water. When watered, it will grow if there’s enough space, increasing its magic score.
