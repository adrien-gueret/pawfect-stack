You are a witch. Not the greatest one of all, far from it! You're just an apprentice — everyone has to start somewhere. Your master has asked you to tidy up his cellar in order to channel all the magic as efficiently as possible. Sounds easy enough, right? But that's without taking into account your master's pet cat, who has plenty to say about it… and seems quite determined to get in your way.

## Oracle of Chaos

You are a cat. Probably the most beautiful one of all, let's be honest. But today, you're worried. Your human has taken on a young witch to tidy up his cellar. And you don't like that one bit! As a proper cat, you'll do everything in your power to make her life difficult. Sounds easy enough, right? But that's without taking into account the little witch, who won't let herself be pushed around — and she's got more than a few magic tricks up her sleeve…

## About items...

In both games, you’ll have to deal with magical items. Some of them have special properties:

### <img width="48" height="48" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a200a559-81ec-4a41-a8b7-3b17e35ab95c" style="image-rendering:pixelated" /> Potion

Very fragile. If another item falls on it, or if it falls by itself, it will break.
  
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/order-205d61.svg" alt="Oracle of Order" /> Place your potions carefully so nothing can fall on them.<br>
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/chaos-a0302d.svg" alt="Oracle of Chaos" /> Drop other items onto these potions... or push them into the void!  

### <img width="48" height="48" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/637b6bc0-72d6-48af-ba7f-e5da5ef5324e" /> Grimories

The more grimoires are placed next to each other, the higher their magic score will be.

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/order-205d61.svg" alt="Oracle of Order" /> Try to place grimoires next to each other.<br>
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/chaos-a0302d.svg" alt="Oracle of Chaos" /> Try to keep grimoires apart.

### <img width="48" height="48" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cc6b067-2e2b-4eef-bae9-512f2c04024e" /> Dried plant

Needs water. When watered, it will grow if there’s enough space, increasing its magic score.

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/order-205d61.svg" alt="Oracle of Order" /> Water them as soon as there’s space so they can grow!<br>
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/chaos-a0302d.svg" alt="Oracle of Chaos" /> Block them to stop them from growing as they should!

## Spells and tricks

The witch can cast spells to aid her in her task, while the cat can pull off a few tricks.

### <img width="60" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/order-205d61.svg" alt="Oracle of Order" /> Witch spells

When starting a level, each spell costs 0 magic. This cost increases after each use (but is capped at 5).

#### <img width="48" height="48" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c99b7bd-4cc9-48de-a74b-933b639fa3f7" /> Rotaleftus / Rotarightus

Rotate **all** items in the reserve 90° to the left or right. Useful for optimizing space when tidying up items.

#### <img width="48" height="48" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fee430b5-c115-4bbf-8e73-1cb2345371c8" /> Hydravo

Cast this spell on the cat to make it run.
Maybe casting it on a dried plant will do something…

#### <img width="48" height="48" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b30a3053-b1e7-4f27-8ecb-52367a62def0" /> Ejectum

Destroy any item in the cellar. This spell is meant to get rid of the cat’s junk, but you can also remove your Master’s items if needed.

### <img width="60" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/chaos-a0302d.svg" alt="Oracle of Chaos" /> Cat tricks

Each trick is free! But don't forget: every time the witch casts _Hydravo_ on you, you **must** use the _Move_ trick to return to the cellar...

#### <img width="48" height="48" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/715cf8b7-12d2-4481-bc05-d8219eafecdc" /> Move

Move the cat anywhere you want in the cellar. If any objects are placed above him, they’ll fall!

#### <img width="48" height="48" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9afdf3b-98ce-42f4-9585-fb2cee6f1ca5" /> Push to left/right

Push any items in the cellar one column to the left or right. Useful for making items fall and disrupting the witch’s tidying.
